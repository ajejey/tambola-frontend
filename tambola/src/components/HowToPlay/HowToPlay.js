            <h3>Objective:</h3>
            <p>The objective of Tambola is to mark off numbers on your ticket as they are called out, in order to achieve a specific pattern or combination.</p>

            <h3>Tickets:</h3>
            <p>Each player will have a ticket with a grid of numbers on it. The numbers range from 1 to 90 and are arranged in a random order across the ticket.</p>

            <h3>Number Calling:</h3>
            <p>A caller randomly selects numbers from 1 to 90 and announces them one by one. The players will mark off the numbers on their respective tickets if they appear.</p>

            <h3>Patterns:</h3>
            <p>The game can have various patterns to achieve a win. Some common patterns include a full house (all numbers marked off), a top line (all numbers in the top row marked off), a middle line (all numbers in the middle row marked off), a bottom line (all numbers in the bottom row marked off), and many more.</p>

            <h3>Winning:</h3>
            <p>The game continues until a player achieves the announced pattern. The first player to achieve the pattern must claim the win.</p>

            <h3>Etiquette:</h3>
            <p>Please maintain fair play and follow the rules of the game. Avoid any form of cheating or tampering with the tickets. Show respect to other players and the caller.</p>
