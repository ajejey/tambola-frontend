            question: "What is Tambola?",
            answer: "Tambola, also known as Housie or Bingo, is a game of chance where players mark off numbers on their tickets as they are called out randomly. The objective is to complete specific patterns on the ticket before other players."

        },
        {
            question: "How are the numbers generated?",
            answer: "Numbers in our online Tambola game are generated using a random number generator to ensure fair play. Each number from 1 to 90 has an equal chance of being selected."

        },
        {
            question: "Can I create multiple rooms?",
            answer: "Yes, you can create multiple rooms. Each room has a unique code that you can share with others to invite them to join your specific game."
        },
        {
            question: "What happens if I lose my internet connection during a game?",
            answer: "If you lose your connection during a game, you can rejoin the same room using the room code. Your ticket and marked numbers will be restored as long as the game is still in progress."
        },
        {
            question: "Are there different winning patterns?",
            answer: "Yes, Tambola can be played with various winning patterns such as Early Five (first to mark 5 numbers), Top Line, Middle Line, Bottom Line, and Full House (all numbers marked). The host of the room typically announces which patterns are being played for."
        },
        {
            question: "Is there a time limit for marking numbers?",
            answer: "No, there is no strict time limit for marking numbers. However, to keep the game flowing, we encourage players to mark their numbers promptly."
        },
        {
            question: "How do I claim a win?",
            answer: "When you complete a winning pattern, you should announce it in the game chat. The host or other players can verify your claim by checking your ticket against the called numbers."
