            <h3>1. Set Clear Objectives</h3>
            <p>
                Begin by establishing specific goals for your event:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Target amount to raise</li>
                <li>Cause or project the funds will support</li>

            </p>

            <h3>2. Form a Planning Committee</h3>
            <p>
                Assemble a team with diverse skills to handle different aspects of the event:
            </p>

                Clearly define responsibilities and establish regular check-ins to ensure everything stays on track.
            </p>

                <li>Cost-effective options (community centers, school halls, religious facilities)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                If possible, secure the venue at a discounted rate or as a donation to maximize fundraising potential.
            </p>

            <h3>4. Determine Pricing Structure</h3>
